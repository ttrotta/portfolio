    "p1": "My name is Thiago Trotta and I'm from Argentina. I got into programming and the IT world when I was 16, and I quickly realized it was something I genuinely enjoyed and wanted to pursue seriously. That's why I'm currently in my fifth year studying Software Engineering and working on personal projects in my free time.",
    "p2": "I have a Full Stack profile, enjoying both frontend and backend development, with a stronger inclination toward backend systems. I believe that mastering AI-driven tools is becoming fundamental for engineers today, so I focus on continuously improving my understanding of requirements, software architecture, and security best practices.",
    "p3": "I enjoy collaborating with others and exchanging ideas, as I believe communication and soft skills are key in today's tech industry. That's what motivated me to work as a teaching assistant during college, and I'm excited about being part of a team where I can continue learning and contributing."
